In addition, you may not use CreeperBot, or any of its source code, in any way:

* That is libelous, defamatory, bigoted, fraudulent, or deceptive;
* That is illegal or unlawful, that would otherwise create liability;

* That discloses private information of any third party (e.g., addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, Social Security numbers, and credit card numbers); and
* That distributes viruses, corrupted data, harmful, disruptive, or destructive files or code.
