# Jack1424 PRIVACY POLICY

Last Revised: 4/13/2023

Our privacy policy applies to information we collect when you invite this bot to your server or are a member of a server that uses this bot. We may change this privacy policy from time to time. Whenever we make changes to this privacy policy, the changes are effective one month after we post the revised privacy policy (as indicated by revising the date at the top of our privacy policy). We encourage you to review our privacy policy whenever you access our services to stay informed about our information practices and how you can help protect your privacy.

## Collection of Information

CreeperBot does not store any information about a server, its content, or its members. CreeperBot will only access the content of new messages to search for the string "creeper" (not case-sensitive). By changing its role permissions, server managers can control which channels CreeperBot can access.

Server managers, not Jack1424, are responsible for maintaining bot permissions.

Occasionally, Jack1424 may collect basic information (only the server name and member count) about the Discord servers that use CreeperBot. Jack1424 will store this information temporarily.

## Use of Information

The information about the servers that use CreeperBot will be collected and stored temporarily to ensure that the current infrastructure supporting CreeperBot is adequate to support its demand and maintain a positive user experience.

## Sharing of Information

Jack1424 will not share any information collected with any third parties.

## Security

We take reasonable measures to help protect information from loss, theft, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.
